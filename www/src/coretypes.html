<h2 id='terms'>Terminology</h2>

<p>
  There are really only two things you need to know about in Rx: types and
  schemata.  A type is an abstract descripition of a type of data.  For
  example, "an integer" or "an associative array" are data types.  When they're
  made into concrete, checkable constraints, they become schemata.  This is
  done by parameterizing them.
</p>

<p>
  A Rx type is identified by a string, its type name.  The type name is broken
  down into two parts, the authority and the subname.  It's written like this:
  <tt>/authority/subname</tt>
</p>

<p>
  While users can define their own custom types, quite a lot of data validation
  rules can be expressed using the <em>core types</em> that come with a basic
  implementation of Rx.  These types use the empty string as their authority,
  which means that they look like this: <tt>//subname</tt>
</p>

<p>
  This page gives a brief overview of the core types, which will be defined
  in detail elsewhere, later.

<h2 id='single'>Single Types</h2>

<p>
  The basic scalar (one-value) types are:
</p>

<table class='types'>
  <tr>
    <th>//nil</th>
    <td>the lack of a value (undef, null, nil, etc)</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>//def</th>
    <td>any defined value; anything that is not //nil</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>//bool</th><td>a value that is either true or false</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>//num</th><td>a number; may be parameterized by a range</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>//int</th>
    <td>a integer; any number such that <tt>(x == floor(x))</tt>; may be
  parameterized by range</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>//str</th>
    <td>a string, even the empty string</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>//scalar</th>
    <td>any single value (or //nil) -- anything but a collecting type</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2 id='collect'>Collection Types</h2>
<p>
  The basic collecting (many-value) types are:
</p>

<table class='types'>
  <tr>
    <th>//arr</th>
    <td>a list of values all of one type; may be parameterized by length</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>//seq</th>
    <td>a list of values all of varying types; each slot has a schema</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>//rec</th>
    <td>a record of named entries, each with its own schema</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>//map</th>
    <td>a map of names to values, with all the values matching one schema</td>
  </tr>
</table>
