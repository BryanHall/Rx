<h2>//seq</h2>

<p>
  The <tt>//seq</tt> type is for a sequence of values that may be of differing
  types.  It must have a <tt>contents</tt> parameter, which is a list of zero
  or more schemata.  To be accepted, input must have at least as many entries
  as the contents parameter, and each item in the input must match the schema
  in the corresponding position in the <tt>//seq</tt> contents.
</p>

<p>
  If a <tt>tail</tt> parameter is given, it will be used to check the contents
  of the input beyond the last item of the <tt>contents</tt>.  In other words,
  given a five-item input against a three-item <tt>//seq</tt>, the
  <tt>tail</tt> will be used to check the last two items.
</p>

<p>
  If there are more input items than content schemata and no <tt>tail</tt> is
  provided, the input will be rejected.
