<h2 id='custom'>Custom Types</h2>

<p>
  Rx validators should be implemented to allow the registration of more types
  by the end user.  There are two ways to do this: naming a schema constructed
  from types or implementing a custom type in the implementation language.
  Schemata constructed from core types are by definition portable to all
  compliant Rx implementations, which makes it a convenient way to quickly
  write portable types.  These types are not (yet) parameterizable, though, and
  are limited to the features provided by core types.
</p>

<p>
  When natively implementing a new type, consider following the example of the
  Rx test suite in providing portable test data for other implementors to test
  against if at all possible.  If portability isn't a goal, of course, you can
  write types that are closely tied to your language's native types without any
  worries.
</p>

<h2 id='meta'>Meta Schema</h2>

<p>
  Rx core types can be used to validate core type schema definitions.  In other
  words, it is possible to write a schema that validates the input used to
  build a schema for any core Rx type.  These schemata live under
  <tt>tag:codesimply.com,2008:rx/meta/</tt>, though implementations are not
  required to implement them.  Their definitions are given on the <a
  href='{{$root}}coretypes.html'>core type</a> pages for each type.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to the metaschemata for each core type, there are two "helper"
  schemata:
</p>

<div class='sample'>
  <p>/.meta/range, the schema for range values:</p>
  <pre class='json'>{
  "type": "//rec",
  "optional": {
    "min"   : { "type": "//num" },
    "max"   : { "type": "//num" },
    "min-ex": { "type": "//num" },
    "max-ex": { "type": "//num" }
  }
}</pre>
</div>

<div class='sample'>
  <p>/.meta/schema, the schema for schemata:</p>
  <pre class='json'>{
  "type": "//any",
  "of": [
    {
      "type"    : "//rec",
      "required": { "type": "//str" },
      "rest"    : "//any"
    },
    "//str",
  ]
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
  When a schema is given as a string <tt>S</tt> it must be replaced with (the
  equivalent of) <tt>{&nbsp;"type":&nbsp;S&nbsp;}</tt> before further
  evaluation.
</p>
